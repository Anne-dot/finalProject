# CNC Machining Centre Enhancement: Final Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the final project components for enhancing a CNC machining centre running Mach3 software. It is part of a larger internship project focused on improving CNC machine functionality and safety. The final project represents a focused, one-month effort within the broader four-month internship.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a tool management system with enhanced data handling
- Implement safety improvements for the M6 tool change macro
- Create a user interface for efficient tool data management
- Design and implement tool movement restrictions
- Develop G-code generation capabilities for horizontal drilling based on DXF data

## Project Scope
The final project focuses on specific, high-impact components of the larger CNC improvement initiative:
1. [Specific component or feature to be determined after reevaluation]
2. [Specific component or feature to be determined after reevaluation]
3. [Specific component or feature to be determined after reevaluation]

## Repository Structure
- `/src`: Source code with English comments
- `/docs`: Technical documentation in English
- `/wiki`: Project documentation and progress journal
