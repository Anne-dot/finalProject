System Environment:

Operating System: Windows 10 Pro (64-bit)
Python Version: 3.6.3
Vectric Aspire: Limited Edition (2005-2009)
Mach3: Version R3.043.022

This specific Mach3 version is important for understanding potential integration approaches. The relatively mature version suggests we'll need to be careful with compatibility and file interaction methods.
Key considerations for this version:

Uses older VBScript macro system
Likely has specific file interaction protocols
May have limitations in direct file access

Project Objective:

Create a tool database management solution
Extend tool tracking capabilities beyond tools.dat limitations
Develop a local web application interface
Integrate with Mach3 workflow

Key Design Considerations:

Preserve existing tools.dat file integrity
Create a separate CSV-based database
Develop a simple, local web interface
Implement Mach3 macro to launch the interface

Proposed Solution Architecture:

Local web application (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
CSV file for extended tool database
VBScript for updating tools.dat
Mach3 macro to trigger the interface

Next Steps:

Define specific additional tool database fields
Design the CSV database structure
Develop the local web interface
Create integration scripts (VBScript)

Challenges to Address:

Compatibility with older software versions
Minimal external dependencies
Simple, reliable file interactions

Documentation Recommendations:

Detailed system environment specifications
Interface design and workflow
File interaction methods
Compatibility considerations
